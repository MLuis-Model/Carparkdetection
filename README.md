## Overview
The Motion Detector is a simple tool that allows you to detect motion in a video file. The tool uses a set of pre-defined coordinates to track motion within a specified region of interest (ROI) in the video. The output of the tool is a video file where the frames containing motion are marked with a bounding box.
